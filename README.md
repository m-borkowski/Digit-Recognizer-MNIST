# Digit-Recognizer-MNIST

Kaggle Competition: [Digit Recognizer](https://www.kaggle.com/c/digit-recognizer).
The goal in this competition is to take an image of a handwritten single digit, and determine what that digit is.

MNIST ("Modified National Institute of Standards and Technology") is the de facto “hello world” dataset of computer vision. Since its release in 1999, this classic dataset of handwritten images has served as the basis for benchmarking classification algorithms. As new machine learning techniques emerge, MNIST remains a reliable resource for researchers and learners alike.
